### Drowsiness Detection: Computer Vision Project, reinforcing machine learning. YOLOv5:

Driver fatigue, or drowsy driving, is the feeling of being tired, sleepy, or exhausted when driving and is a major cause of crashes. It affects everyone regardless of driving experience, but experienced drivers are often better able to avoid fatigue by knowing when to take a break.

A computer aided application that monitors for fatigue and can detect drowsiness using facial cues,built on the powerful YOLOv5 object detection algorithm developed by *ultralytics*.

Simply take a selfie or drop your image by following the prompts on the application.
